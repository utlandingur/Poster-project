# Poster project
This is a simple project for Vefsk√≥li to replicate a poster that we would see around town.
I have chosen to use Hringdu.

## How it works
I want to practice more with tailwindCSS so I have installed that in my project and used this.
I have made the image cover the whole screen and then placed large text near the bottom.

## Issues
* The text is not dynamic and does not change based on viewport width. As it is a poster to see around town, I didn't think this would matter.
* The actual "poster" on the website uses two SVGs sat behind the H1 elements and then applies a curved div after the second H1 SVG in order to create a nicer shape. I decided that was out of the scope of this and not worth the time.
